Networking fundamentals
-IP Addressing: Unique numerical labels assigned to devices on a network (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
-Subnetting: Divides IP ranges into smaller segments to improve traffic management.
-CIDR Notation: Defines IP address ranges (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24 means 256 IP addresses).

-DNS Records:
--A: Maps domain to IP (IPv4).
--CNAME: Maps one domain to another.


-HTTP/HTTPS: Used for web traffic (ports 80, 443). HTTPS is secure.
-SSH (Port 22): Secure remote access to servers.
-FTP (Port 21): Transfers files between systems.
-DNS (Port 53): Domain name lookups.
-SMTP (Port 25): Email sending protocol.

-Load Balancer: Distributes incoming requests across multiple servers to improve performance and reliability.
-Reverse Proxy: Sits between clients and backend servers to forward requests, providing security and caching.

-Firewall: Filters traffic based on rules, protecting networks from unauthorized access.
-Security Groups: Virtual firewalls for cloud instances, defining allowed inbound/outbound traffic.

-Vpc: our own personal cloud where we have Virtual Machine
-Subnets: Segments within a VPC. Public subnets expose resources to the internet, while private subnets are internal.
-Route Tables: Define how traffic is routed within a VPC.
-Internet Gateway: Allows internet access for resources in public subnets.
-NAT Gateway: Enables outbound internet traffic for private subnet instances.
